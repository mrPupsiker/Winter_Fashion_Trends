# Winter_Fashion_Trends
This is my university project on "Basics of working with data for artificial intelligence"
The aim of this project is to show my skills in working with data.
I analysed the data from csv using pandas and numpy, visualized it using matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
Then I created a dashbord with 3 charts and some interactive features.
